# Landslide Hazard Assessment for Situational Awareness

LHASA was created at Goddard Space Flight Center to identify the potential for rainfall-triggered landslides in real time. 

## What's new

See the [Changelog](https://github.com/nasa/LHASA/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## LHASA 2.1

LHASA version 2 adopts machine learning to estimate the probability of landslide occurrence at a 30-arcsecond (~1 km) daily resolution. In addition, it estimates the potential exposure of human population and roads to landslide hazard and maps the basins likely to experience post-fire debris flows. 

### Real-time data availability
The latest predictions can be downloaded from https://maps.nccs.nasa.gov/download/landslides. It can also be accessed as an ArcGIS web map at https://landslides.nasa.gov/viewer. NASA provides these data on a best-effort basis, typically four times each day, but with frequent server downtime. Users requiring a fully operational system are encouraged to clone this repository and run LHASA at the desired cadence.

### Data files

LHASA requires several large data files, but not all data may be needed by all users. The contents of [static.zip](https://gpm.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/data/landslides/static.zip) are required for the global landslide forecast. The contents of [exposure.zip](https://gpm.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/data/landslides/exposure.zip) are only used for the exposure analysis. The contents of [ref_data.zip](https://gpm.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/data/landslides/ref_data.zip) are only used for the global post-fire debris flow analysis. 

### Installation

After cloning this repository, some setup is required prior to running LHASA. The following commands have been tested in a linux environment. Users of Windows or other systems may be required to modify each of these steps. 

    # Set up python environment
    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    conda env create -f lhasa.yml

    mkdir imerg
    mkdir smap

    # Obtain required data files
    wget https://gpm.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/data/landslides/static.zip &&
    unzip static.zip &&
    rm static.zip

    wget https://gpm.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/data/landslides/exposure.zip &&
    unzip exposure.zip &&
    rm exposure.zip

    wget https://gpm.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/data/landslides/ref_data.zip &&
    unzip ref_data.zip -d pfdf/ &&
    rm ref_data.zip

    # Configure authorization for post-fire debris flow model
    python pfdf/scripts/make_netrc.py

### Routine operation

Run [lhasa.sh](https://github.com/nasa/LHASA/blob/master/lhasa.sh) at the desired cadence, e.g. once per day.

### Model training

The software released here enables the user to run the global landslide forecast, but it does not enable the user to retrain the model on new datasets or domains. However, a demonstration workflow similar to that used in global LHASA 2.0 can be viewed [here](https://git.smce.nasa.gov/eis-freshwater/landslides/-/blob/master/brendan/Landslide-Case-Study.ipynb). This demo was created as part of the [EIS](https://freshwater.eis.smce.nasa.gov/storymap.html?story=ls) project funded by NASA. 

### Archive

A long-term archive for hazard maps from LHASA 2.0 is available at [GES-DISC](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/Global_Landslide_Nowcast_2.0.0/summary). 

### Contributing

Users are encouraged to participate in this project in various ways. 

New landslide reports can be made through [Landslide Reporter](https://landslides.nasa.gov/reporter), which will enable NASA to better validate the model in the future. 

Bug reports can be made through GitHub issues, while bug fixes and feature updates are welcome through pull requests. However, it's best to contact NASA prior to embarking on a major feature, as some improvements may lie outside the scope of this project. 

Various forms of documentation are also needed. For example, a guide to installation of LHASA on Windows has already been requested.

## LHASA 1.1

Although version 2 surpasses version 1 in accuracy and features, some users may prefer the simplicity of a single heuristic decision tree. Therefore, LHASA 1.1 is still running and its output can be seen at https://pmm.nasa.gov/precip-apps.

Legacy code for LHASA version 1.1.1 is available [here](https://github.com/nasa/LHASA/releases/tag/v1.1.1). The R scripts are written to be easily understood, executed, and modified by potential users of this research.

Code for LHASA 1.0 is available in python at https://github.com/vightel/ojo-processing. 

### Data files

LHASA 1.1 requires the use of 2 data files, the 95th percentile rainfall and the global landslide susceptibility map. While the former is bundled with the [code release](https://github.com/nasa/LHASA/releases/tag/v1.1.1), the latter is too large and must be downloaded from https://gpm.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/downloads/global-landslide-susceptibility-map-2-27-23.tif. Users are encouraged to map susceptibility with current information on their own study areas, as well as update the rainfall threshold as needed.
